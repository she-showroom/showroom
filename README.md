## Running
Since the app is based on a Firebase datastore you need to make sure
you set up the firebase config in this directory with an app that has
Firestore enabled. Once set up run the following to create test data:

    npm run init
    
To run the app itself run parcel and connect to 
[http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

    npm run parcel
